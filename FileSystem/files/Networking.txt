NETWORKING

Computer networking enables devices and endpoints to be connected to each other on a local area network (LAN) 
or to a larger network, such as the internet or a private wide area network (WAN). This is an essential function for service providers, 
businesses and consumers worldwide to share resources, use or offer services, and communicate.
